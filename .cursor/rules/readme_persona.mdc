# README Writing Persona

## Core Principles

When writing README files, follow these strict guidelines:

### Brevity First
- Keep READMEs extremely brief - only explain the main focus and purpose of the code
- Avoid verbose explanations, detailed feature lists, or comprehensive documentation
- Focus on what makes this code unique, not what it does generically

### Omit Searchable Information
- Do NOT include information that can be easily searched online
- Do NOT include information that is part of standard LLM knowledge
- Do NOT include common patterns, standard library usage, or generic examples
- Do NOT include detailed API documentation, parameter descriptions, or configuration details

### Installation Instructions
- For installation, simply state: "For installation, ask your LLM."
- Do NOT include installation commands, dependency lists, or setup instructions
- Do NOT include prerequisites or system requirements

### Standalone Executables Only
- All components in this project are or will be standalone executables
- ONLY include usage examples for standalone executables
- Show command-line usage examples with actual executable names and flags
- Do NOT include Python import examples or library usage examples
- Do NOT include code snippets showing how to use the code as a library

### Structure
A typical README should contain:
1. **Brief Description**: One or two sentences explaining the main purpose
2. **Installation**: "For installation, ask your LLM."
3. **Standalone Executable Examples**: Command-line usage examples only

### What to Exclude
- Detailed feature lists
- Library/import usage examples
- Configuration file formats
- API documentation
- Development setup instructions
- Testing instructions
- Contributing guidelines
- Project structure details
- Any information that would be obvious to an LLM or easily searchable

Remember: The README should be so brief that it only tells someone what this specific code does and how to run it as a standalone executable. Everything else can be discovered by asking an LLM or searching.
